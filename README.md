# Introduction
- This Flask application uses SQLAlchemy and marshmallow(for serializing/deseaializing) to make a small, REST + CRUD(create, read, update, delete) API.
    
   # Getting started
   
    * `git clone` the repo!
    * If you're using a virtual environment activate it!(I'll assume virtualenv with the named environment "venv"),
    * Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all the dependancies. 
    * `python app.py` should get you up and running! 
    * Try it out in Postman! (postman is a API development environment that lets you test PUT, GET, DELETE, POST functionality)
